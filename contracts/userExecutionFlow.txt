User Execution Flow:

1) buys tokens from the token contract based on predefined tokens per wei value
	- Token buyTokens()

2) gives allowance to the controller contract to move tokens on its behalf
	- Token increaseAllowance(spender, amount)

3) calls mint on controller contract to receive 1 NFT for the predefined number of tokens
	-  Controller mintNFT()

4) Using safeTransferFrom the user transfers the NFT to the controller contract, initating the staking process
	- NFT safeTransferFrom() 

5) User accumulates staking rewards in tokens for the predefined stakingRewards amount per day

6) 

   They can either claim rewards WITHOUT removing their NFT from the controller
	- claimRewards(amount, false)

   or claim AND remove
   	- claimRewards(amount, true) 

Claiming without removing ensures the staked NFT continutes to accrue staking rewards
